# Cost Optimization Recommendations with Azure Advisor

## **Overview**
Azure Advisor provides actionable recommendations to optimize costs, improve performance, and enhance security. Below are the cost-saving opportunities identified for the given resources along with proposed optimizations.

---

## **Cost-Saving Opportunities**

### **1. Right-Size Virtual Machines (VMs)**

#### **Issue**:
Several VMs are underutilized, running at less than 20% CPU utilization and memory usage over the past 30 days.

#### **Recommendation**:
- Use Azure Advisor's right-sizing recommendations to move to smaller VM sizes or burstable instances.
- For test and development workloads, consider using **B-series VMs**.

#### **Proposed Action**:
1. Identify affected VMs:
   ```bash
   az advisor recommendation list --category Cost --query "[?impactedField=='Virtual Machines']"
   ```
2. Resize VMs:
   ```bash
   az vm resize --resource-group <resource-group> --name <vm-name> --size <new-size>
   ```

#### **Estimated Savings**:
Up to **30%** of current compute costs for underutilized VMs.

---

### **2. Use Reserved Instances (RIs)**

#### **Issue**:
On-demand VMs are used for workloads that have predictable, steady usage patterns.

#### **Recommendation**:
- Purchase 1-year or 3-year Reserved Instances (RIs) for long-running workloads.
- Use Azure Cost Management to analyze RI savings potential.

#### **Proposed Action**:
1. Identify eligible resources with steady usage.
2. Purchase RIs:
   ```bash
   az consumption reservation purchase --reservation-order-id <id> --sku <sku-name> --quantity <quantity>
   ```

#### **Estimated Savings**:
Save up to **72%** compared to pay-as-you-go rates.

---

### **3. Optimize Storage Costs**

#### **Issue**:
Premium and standard storage accounts have unused capacity or are not tiered optimally.

#### **Recommendation**:
- Move infrequently accessed data to **Cool** or **Archive** tiers.
- Consolidate underutilized storage accounts.

#### **Proposed Action**:
1. Analyze storage usage:
   ```bash
   az storage account show-usage --resource-group <resource-group>
   ```
2. Tier infrequent data:
   ```bash
   az storage blob set-tier --account-name <account-name> --container-name <container> --name <blob-name> --tier Cool
   ```

#### **Estimated Savings**:
Up to **50%** reduction in storage costs for archival data.

---

### **4. Leverage Autoscaling for App Services**

#### **Issue**:
Web applications are deployed with constant instance counts, leading to over-provisioning during off-peak hours.

#### **Recommendation**:
- Enable autoscaling for Azure App Service plans to adjust instances based on traffic.

#### **Proposed Action**:
1. Set up autoscale rules:
   ```bash
   az monitor autoscale create --resource-group <resource-group> --resource <app-service-name> --min-count 1 --max-count 5 --count 1
   ```
2. Define autoscale conditions for CPU/memory usage.

#### **Estimated Savings**:
Reduce costs by **20-40%** during low-traffic periods.

---

### **5. Remove Unused Resources**

#### **Issue**:
Unused resources, such as idle VMs, unattached disks, and unused public IPs, are incurring costs.

#### **Recommendation**:
- Identify and delete unused resources.
- Schedule periodic reviews using Azure Resource Graph or Azure Cost Management.

#### **Proposed Action**:
1. Identify unused resources:
   ```bash
   az resource list --query "[?tags=='unused']"
   ```
2. Delete resources:
   ```bash
   az resource delete --ids <resource-id>
   ```

#### **Estimated Savings**:
Immediate cost reduction by eliminating unnecessary resources.

---

### **6. Utilize Azure Hybrid Benefit**

#### **Issue**:
Windows Server and SQL Server VMs are running without leveraging existing on-premises licenses.

#### **Recommendation**:
- Enable Azure Hybrid Benefit for eligible VMs to use existing licenses.

#### **Proposed Action**:
1. Check eligibility and enable the benefit:
   ```bash
   az vm update --resource-group <resource-group> --name <vm-name> --license-type Windows_Server
   ```

#### **Estimated Savings**:
Save up to **40%** on licensing costs.
